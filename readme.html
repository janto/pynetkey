<h1>Pynetkey</h1>
<p>
This program was <em><font color="red">not written by IT</font></em> and is not supported by them!<br />
Pynetkey's main goals are to be more robust and prettier (it sits in the system tray) than the existing inetkey/sinetkey. It also runs on both Windows and Linux systems. Pynetkey is released under the GPL.

<h2>Windows Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>download <code>pynetkey.zip</code> from the main site</li>
<li>extract somewhere and run <code>pynetkey.exe</code></li>
<li>(optional) create a shortcut to <code>pynetkey.exe</code> (such as on your desktop)</li>
</ol>

<h3>building from source</h3>

<p>
See the Ubuntu section to get the latest sources. Run <code>build.bat</code> to create a distribution file.
</p>

Build requirements:
<ul>
<li>python2.5</li>
<li>py2exe</li>
<li>pywin32 (210 works. popup menu icons disappeared for 211,212,213)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ubuntu Installation</h2>

<p>
The GUI version was developed with an ubuntu/gnome system in mind. A minimal non-gui version is also available as <code>cli.py</code> and should run on most systems.
</p>

To install the GUI version:
<ol>
<li>Install some packages:
<pre>sudo aptitude install python-eggtrayicon</pre>
</li>
<li>Download the source. There are three ways:
	<ul>
	<li>download <code>pynetkey.tar.gz</code> from the main site</li>
	<li>get the bleeding edge sources from the main repository (for this to work you need to be already connected to the internet):
		<pre>hg clone http://bitbucket.org/janto/pynetkey/</pre>
	</li>
	<li>get the source from a local repository mirror (might be slightly outdated):
		<pre>hg clone static-http://dip.sun.ac.za/~janto/pynetkey/repo pynetkey</pre>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>run <code>pynetkey.py</a>
<li> (optional) create a shortcut to <code>pynetkey.py</code> (you can use <code>icons/main.ico</code> as an icon)
</ol>

<h2>Config File</h2>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<em><font color="red">WARNING:</font></em> Please be aware how dangerous it is to store your username and password on your computer. If you don't know why this is dangerous, I suggest you rather not do it. Someone can easily steal your password. This is also why I won't make this feature easily available from the GUI. IT won't like the idea of people storing their passwords on disk.

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>
Pynetkey's default behaviour can be modified by creating a config file in the following location (or just select "Edit config file..." from the popup menu):
<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>~\inetkey.ini</code> (i.e. <code>C:\Documents and Settings\username\inetkey.ini</code>)
<li>On Linux: <code>~/.inetkeyrc</code>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pynetkey will automatically encode the password to prevent wandering eyes from stealing your password, but it is <em><font color="red">NOT</font></em> the same as it being encrypted.</li>
<li>Setting <code>open_on_launch=1</code> (the default) will open the firewall on launch. Set <code>open_on_launch=0</code> to disable this feature.</li>
<li>If you're on Stellenbosch Community Network it might help setting <code>connection_url</code> to <code>https://fw4.sun.ac.za:950</code> or fw1 or fw2...</li>
<li>You can also force an open and close event at scheduled times. This is useful for things like late night downloads / torrents. The current implementation is accurate to within 30 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
<pre>
[config]
username = 12345678
password = supersecret
open_on_launch = 1
connection_url = https://fw.sun.ac.za:950

[events]
open = 01:55
close = 07:55
</pre>
