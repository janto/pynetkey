Pynetkey's main goals are to be more robust and prettier (it sits in the system tray) than the existing inetkey/sinetkey.
</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<ol>
<li>download <a href="pynetkey.zip">pynetkey.zip</a>
<li>extract somewhere and run <code>pynetkey.exe</code>
<li> (optional) create a shortcut to <code>pynetkey.exe</code> on your desktop
</ol>

<h3>building from source</h3>

<p>
See the Ubuntu section to get the latest sources. Run <code>build.bat</code> to create a distribution file.
</p>

Build requirements:
<ul>
<li> python2.5
<li> py2exe
<li> pywin32 (210 works. popup menu icons disappeared for 211,212,213)
</ul>

<h2>Ubuntu</h2>

<p>
A minimal non-gui version is also available as <a href="cli.py">cli.py</a>
</p>

To install the GUI version:
<ol>
<li>Install some packages:
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 python-gnome2-extras</pre>
</li>
<li>Download the source. There are two ways:
	<ul>
	<li>download <a href="pynetkey.tar.gz">pynetkey.tar.gz</a></li>
	<li>get the bleeding edge sources from the repository
		<pre>svn co checkout: http://svn.assembla.com/svn/pynetkey</pre>
		for this to work you will need to set up the firewall in your  <code>~/.subversion/servers</code> file
		<pre>
[global]
http-proxy-exceptions = *.sun.ac.za
http-proxy-host = proxy.sun.ac.za
http-proxy-port = 3128
		</pre>
		This is a bit of a catch-22 situation, since you already need something like inetkey to get to assembla.com. Sorry about that.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>run <code>pynetkey.py</a>
<li> (optional) create a shortcut to <code>pynetkey.py</code> (you can use <code>icons/main.ico</code> as an icon)
</ol>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
To avoid prompting for the username and password every time you start pynetkey, you can place it in a config file.
</p>
<p>
<em><font color="red">WARNING</font></em>: Please be aware how dangerous this is. If you don't know why this is dangerous, I suggest you rather not do it. Someone can easily steal your password. This is also why I won't make this feature easily available from the GUI. IT won't like the idea of people storing their passwords on disk.
</p>

Location (or just select "Edit config file..." from the popup menu):
<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>~\inetkey.ini</code> (i.e. <code>C:\Documents and Settings\username\inetkey.ini</code>)
<li>On Linux: <code>~/.inetkeyrc</code>
</ul>

<p>
You can also force open and close events at scheduled times. This is useful for things like late night downloads / torrents. The current implementation is accurate to within 30 seconds. Will fix if I ever have time.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
[config]
username=12345678
password=supersecret

[events]
open = 01:55
close = 07:55
</pre>

<p>
The password will automatically be encoded (<em>not encrypted</em>) to prevent wandering eyes from stealing your password.
</p>

<h2>todo</h2>
<ul>
<li>port to wx (easier to manage cross platform)
<li>links to help file
</ul>
